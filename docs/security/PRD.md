## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

```python

        self.token_manager = TokenManager()
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter()
        self.ip_controller = IPController()
        self.session_manager = SessionManager()
        self.audit_logger = AuditLogger()
        self.encryption_service = EncryptionService()
        self.anonymizer = DataAnonymizer()
        self.gdpr_manager = GDPRManager()
        self.security_assessor = SecurityAssessor()

class OAuth2Provider:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client_registry = {}
        self.token_store = {}
        self.scope_manager = ScopeManager()

class TokenManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.token_generator = JWTGenerator()
        self.token_validator = JWTValidator()
        self.token_blacklist = TokenBlacklist()
```

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE security_events (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    user_id UUID,
    ip_address INET,
    details JSONB,
    severity VARCHAR(20)
);

CREATE TABLE security_tokens (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    token_type VARCHAR(20),
    user_id UUID,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP,
    is_revoked BOOLEAN,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE security_settings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    setting_type VARCHAR(50),
    value JSONB,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
